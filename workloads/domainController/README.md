## Overview

Welcome to the Azure Quickstart Templates repository! 🚀

This repository houses baseline templates and deployments for Domain Controllers in Azure. 

## This Repository

- Quickstart Templates: Our templates cover a wide range of scenarios, from deploying virtual machines and storage accounts to setting up web apps and databases. You’ll find examples written in various languages, including PowerShell, ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates, Bicep, and Terraform.

- Easy Integration: Each template is well-documented and ready for integration into your projects. Simply choose the one that fits your use case, customize it as needed, and deploy it directly to your Azure environment.

## Supported Languages

1. PowerShell: If you’re comfortable with PowerShell scripting, we’ve got you covered. Our PowerShell templates automate resource provisioning, configuration, and management.
2. ARM Templates: The classic choice for Azure deployments, ARM templates define your infrastructure as code. Use them to create consistent environments across your applications.
3. Bicep: Bicep is an exciting new language that simplifies ARM template creation. It’s concise, expressive, and designed to enhance your productivity.
4. Terraform: If something is wrong with you, and you prefer HashiCorp’s Terraform, we’ve included templates written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Terraform provides a powerful way to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Explore our templates, learn from the examples, and adapt them to your specific needs. Whether you’re deploying a small web app or orchestrating a complex multi-region setup, the Azure Quickstart Templates have you covered.

Feel free to contribute your own templates or report issues. Let’s build together! 🌟

Remember, these templates are here to make your Azure journey smoother. Happy deploying! 🎉
